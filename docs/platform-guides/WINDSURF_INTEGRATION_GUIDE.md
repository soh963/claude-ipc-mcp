## 🎯 What This Guide Does

This guide will enable your Windsurf AI assistant (Cascade) to:
- 💬 Send messages to other AI assistants (Claude Code, Gemini, etc.)
- 📨 Receive messages from other AIs
- 🤝 Collaborate with multiple AIs on the same project
- 🖥️ Work across Windows and WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

**Time Required**: About 15-20 minutes

## ✅ Prerequisites

### 1. Windsurf IDE
You need Windsurf installed on Windows. If you don't have it:
- Download from: https://windsurf.com/editor
- Install with default settings

### 2. Python (Check First!)

Open PowerShell and type:
```powershell
python --version
```

**If you see** `Python 3.12.x` or higher ➡️ Skip to step 3!

**If you get an error**:
1. Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Download Python 3.12 or newer
3. **IMPORTANT**: During installation, ✅ CHECK "Add Python to PATH"
4. After installation, close and reopen PowerShell
5. Verify with `python --version`

### 3. A Way to Get the Code

You need ONE of these:
- **GitHub Desktop** (easiest) - Download from https://desktop.github.com/
- **Git for Windows** - From https://git-scm.com/download/win
- **Web browser** (to download a ZIP file)

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Installation

### Step 1: Get the Claude IPC MCP Code

#### Option A: Using GitHub Desktop (Recommended for Beginners)
1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. Click `File` → `Clone Repository`
3. Click the `URL` tab
4. Paste: `https://github.com/soh963/claude-ipc-mcp.git`
5. For "Local Path", browse to: `C:\Users\[YourUsername]\Documents`
6. Click `Clone`

#### Option B: Using Git Command Line
Open PowerShell and run:
```powershell
cd C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\Documents
git clone https://github.com/soh963/claude-ipc-mcp.git
```

#### Option C: Download ZIP (No Git Needed)
1. Go to https://github.com/soh963/claude-ipc-mcp
2. Click the green `Code` button
3. Click `Download ZIP`
4. Extract to `C:\Users\[YourUsername]\Documents\`
5. Rename the folder from `claude-ipc-mcp-main` to `claude-ipc-mcp`

### Step 2: Install UV (Python Package Manager)

In PowerShell, run this command:
```powershell
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

You should see:
```
everything's installed!
```

**If you get a security error**, run PowerShell as Administrator and try:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```
Then run the UV install command again.

### Step 3: Add UV to Your Current Session

Run this command exactly as shown:
```powershell
$env:Path = "C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\.local\bin;$env:Path"
```

This makes UV available for the next steps.

### Step 4: Install IPC Dependencies

Navigate to the IPC folder:
```powershell
cd C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\Documents\claude-ipc-mcp
```

Install dependencies:
```powershell
uv sync
```

This will download and install all required packages. You'll see progress messages.

### Step 5: Configure Windsurf

First, create the configuration directory:
```powershell
mkdir C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\.codeium\windsurf -Force
```

Now create the configuration file:
```powershell
notepad C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\.codeium\windsurf\mcp_config.json
```

Notepad will open. Choose ONE of these configurations:

#### Option A: Open Mode (No Authentication - Recommended for Personal Use)
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "claude-ipc": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "C:\\Users\\YOUR_USERNAME\\Documents\\claude-ipc-mcp", "claude-ipc-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Option B: Secure Mode (With Shared Secret)
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "claude-ipc": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "C:\\Users\\YOUR_USERNAME\\Documents\\claude-ipc-mcp", "claude-ipc-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "IPC_SHARED_SECRET": "your-secret-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual Windows username!
- If using Secure Mode, replace `your-secret-key-here` with your chosen secret
- All AIs must use the same secret to communicate

For example, if your username is "john" and using Open Mode:
```json
"args": ["--from", "C:\\Users\\john\\Documents\\claude-ipc-mcp", "claude-ipc-mcp"]
```

Save the file (Ctrl+S) and close Notepad.

### Step 6: Test the Installation (Optional but Recommended)

Let's verify everything works before connecting to Windsurf:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\Documents\claude-ipc-mcp
C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\.local\bin\uvx.exe --from . claude-ipc-mcp
```

You should see:
```
INFO:claude_ipc_server:SQLite database initialized...
INFO:claude_ipc_server:Message broker listening on 127.0.0.1:9876
```

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the test.

### Step 7: Restart Windsurf

1. **Completely close Windsurf**:
   - Look in your system tray (bottom-right near the clock)
   - Right-click any Windsurf icon and choose Exit
2. Wait 10 seconds
3. Open Windsurf again

## 🧪 Testing Your Setup

### In Windsurf's Cascade Panel:

1. Find the Cascade panel (usually on the right side)
2. In the chat area, type:
   ```
   Register this instance as windsurf
   ```
3. You should see a confirmation message

### Test Commands:
Try these commands in Cascade:
- `List all IPC instances` - Should show "windsurf"
- `Check my messages` - Should show "No new messages"

## 💬 Using IPC in Windsurf

### Basic Commands

**Register your AI:**
```
Register this instance as [name]
```
Example: `Register this instance as windsurf`

**Send a message:**
```
Send message to [recipient]: [your message]
```
Example: `Send message to claude: Can you help with this React component?`

**Check messages:**
```
Check my messages
```

**List all AIs:**
```
List all instances
```

### Communication Example

If you have Claude Code running in WSL:
1. In Windsurf: `Send message to claude: Hello from Windows!`
2. In Claude Code: Claude types `Check my messages`
3. Claude sees your message and can reply back

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "uvx is not recognized"
- Run: `$env:Path = "C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\.local\bin;$env:Path"`
- This adds UV to your current PowerShell session

### "No such file or directory"
- Check that you used double backslashes `\\` in the JSON config
- Verify the path exists: `dir C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\Documents\claude-ipc-mcp`

### Cascade doesn't recognize IPC commands
1. Check Windsurf Settings → Cascade → Plugins
2. Look for "claude-ipc" in the list
3. If not there, verify your `mcp_config.json` file
4. Make sure you fully restarted Windsurf

### "Connection refused" error
- This is normal if no AI has registered yet
- The first AI to register starts the server

### Windows Defender / Firewall Alert
- If prompted, allow the connection
- IPC only uses localhost (127.0.0.1), not internet

### "Invalid auth token" error
- This means you're trying to connect with different security modes
- Solution: All AIs must either use Open Mode OR all use the same shared secret
- Check your `mcp_config.json` configuration

## 🔄 After a Reboot

The good news: **Almost everything persists!**

What stays configured:
- ✅ Windsurf MCP configuration
- ✅ Your IPC installation
- ✅ All messages in the database

What you might need to do:
- If UV commands don't work in PowerShell, run:
  ```powershell
  $env:Path = "C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\.local\bin;$env:Path"
  ```

To make UV permanent (optional):
1. Press `Win + X` → System
2. Advanced system settings → Environment Variables
3. Under User variables, edit Path
4. Add: `C:\Users\[YourUsername]\.local\bin`

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Do I need to keep PowerShell open?**
A: No! Once configured, Windsurf handles everything automatically.

**Q: Where are messages stored?**
A: In `C:\Users\[YourUsername]\.claude-ipc-data\messages.db`

**Q: Can I use this with WSL?**
A: Yes! Windows Windsurf can communicate with Claude Code running in WSL.

**Q: What is "open mode"?**
A: It means no password/authentication is required. Good for personal use.

**Q: Should I use Open Mode or Secure Mode?**
A: 
- **Open Mode**: Perfect for personal use on your own computer
- **Secure Mode**: Better if multiple people use your computer or for production environments

**Q: How do I switch between Open and Secure mode?**
A: Edit your `mcp_config.json` file and either add or remove the `env` section with the shared secret.

**Q: How do I know it's working?**
A: If "Register this instance" works in Cascade, everything is set up correctly!

**Q: Can multiple AIs run at once?**
A: Yes! The first one becomes the server, others connect as clients.
